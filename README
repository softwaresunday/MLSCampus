To run the ant build

1) The Android build.xml requires Ant 1.8! So change the ant home in Eclipse preferences (Ant - Runtime - Ant Home) (and install Ant 1.8 first if necessary)
2) create a file "local.properties" with two properties that define the location of your local android sdk and apache.  
This does not get checked into source control.  Mine looks like so:
sdk.dir=/usr/local/android-sdk-mac_x86
apache.dir=/path/to/apache/htdocs
2) In Eclipse, right-click build.xml -> Run As - Ant Build...
* check "Install"
* Run (from then on you can just do Run As - Ant Build)
-or-
from the command line within the Touchv1 directory, run this command:
ant install
